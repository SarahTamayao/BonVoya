## Overview

### Description

This is an iOS application developed for iPhone that provides popular spots, activities, local news, etc. based on user input for location and dates of travel. Using this information, the user will then be able to create an itinerary, which allows for seamless planning and organization of activities and POIs related to a specific location where the user plans to travel.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Travel
- **Mobile:** This app will exclusively be developed and available for iPhone. Although it is possible to create a web-based version of this application, this app is designed to be a quick, easy, and user-friendly way to quickly make an itinerary and get information about certain locations at your fingertips. This app can also utilize your current location to find popular cities near you, if no preferred cities have been chosen.
- **Story:** Asks user for favorite travel locations and dates of travel, which will then be used to personalize a feed and dashboard with attractions for those locations and allow the user to create an itinerary and add favorite locations and preferred dates & times to that itinerary.
- **Market:** This app is mostly suited for those who travel, irrespective of how often or how little they travel. Additionally, users may just want to use the to find information about locations they are curious about.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as much or as little as the user likes, this depends on how much they travel and how often they’d like to retrieve personalized information about places that they find interesting.
- **Scope:** This app will require relatively 5-10 hours of work per week, per group member, in order to complete on time. We could always scale down or scale up, depending on how the development process is coming along. A stripped-down version of this app would definitely still be very interesting to build.
